# Chapter 1 - Hello World

## Hello World in Java

We first begin by compiling and run a classic Java hello world program:
Write the following in `HelloWorld.java` (the class name must be the same as filename by java requirement)

``` java
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello World!");
  }
}
```

Compile and Run:

``` cmd
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

Interestingly, if you pay attention, `java` actually takes the class name instead of the filename.
It just assumes the `HelloWorld` class must exists in `HelloWorld.class` file, but what does it mean "to exist" in there?
The file isn't that big, only 426 bytes in my case:

``` cmd
Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
-a----        2024/09/29     12:38            426 HelloWorld.class
...
```

So how about just take a look inside with a hex editor?

Interesting, looks like a lot of strings here. Maybe there is something I can mess with? I see the string "Hello World!" here, let me hex edit it to something else:

``` hexl
...
00000060: 0015 4c6a 6176 612f 696f 2f50 7269 6e74  ..Ljava/io/Print
00000070: 5374 7265 616d 3b08 000e 0100 0c42 7965  Stream;......Bye
00000080: 2020 2057 6f72 6c64 210a 0010 0011 0700     World!.......
00000090: 120c 0013 0014 0100 136a 6176 612f 696f  .........java/io
...
```

And... it works!

``` cmd
java HelloWorld
Bye   World!
```

OK, that is enough exciting messing around, let's try to understand what we are looking at by reading some specs, here I find the oracle documentation very helpful: [Chapter 4. The class File Format](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html)

Walking through all of the fields is surprisingly tedious, so I'm not going to ðŸ˜œ. The difficulty comes from the variable length field, different types can actually be different length. But please still try reading the file if you want to. Try to understand the syntax and change something to see what will happen!

## Hello World hand made

Now armed with our new understanding of the class file. Can we make our own class file by just deposit bytes into a file? The class file structure seems simple enough for me to just do so.

I am going to use [NASM](https://nasm.us/) for this purpose, honestly, any assembler probably works for this purpose since we are not *actually* doing assembler, only using the `db` directory to deposit bytes directly into the file.

Speaking of `db`, you should investigate it a bit more and NASM has a great documentation on this: [3.2.1 Dx: Declaring Initialized Data](https://www.nasm.us/doc/nasmdoc3.html#section-3.2.1). But the simple explaination is that `db` just put a byte into the file, and we want to put the number in byte-by-byte because Java is big-endian and Intel platform (which NASM targets) is little-endian. So just put in bytes makes a lot more sense for our use case.

Now, let's finally start writing our class in assembly!

I used a NASM macro to cleanup the code. But if your assembler don't understand that,
use something like `db 0x00,0x43` achieves the same effect of `dwbe 0x0043`.
``` nasm
%macro dwbe 1
	db ((%1)>>8),((%1)&0xff)
%endmacro
```

Now, if you want to, take a look at [HelloWorld.asm](HelloWorld.asm) which is a translation of the class file I have shown erlier.
The result is quite messy, so I'll only explain some big picture things.

 - The first 8 bytes is just some stuff to let JVM know this is a valid class file and it can run the file.
 - Next is the "constant section", which makes up the majority part of the file. The type of entires is identified by the first byte of each entry. But most specification is quite simple, you can probably guess what each entry does by looking at the assembly file.
 - Then some other information about the class: the access flags (public/private/interface), name of the class, name of the super class.
 - We don't implement interfaces and there is no fields in the class, so those can be skipped.
 - Methods! This is the most interesting part, but that also makes it the most complicated part. I'll save the exploration of this part for later and you can refer to [Section 6](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se8/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.6) of *The class File Format* for more info.
 - At the end here is attributes for the entire class file. In our case it just stores `SourceFile=HelloWorld.java`.

To assemble the program and test it:
``` cmd
nasm -f bin -o HelloWorld.class HelloWorld.asm
java HelloWorld
```
`-f bin` specify the output format, here we request NASM just output whatever it generates and do not try to package them into some linkable or executable format.
`-o HelloWorld.class` specify the name of output file, this is important because Java looks for class by filename.
When compiled correctly, the new `HelloWorld.class` should be **identical** to the file compiled with `javac` earlier, and execute it with `java` of course still works.

## Macros

I should say writing assembler macro is not the point of this little article. So I am not going to walk through all the implementation details. I'll only encourage those who are interested to read the macro implementation, they are not that complicated.
However, knowing how to use these macros are going to be important in the following sections. So I shall direct your attention to [HelloWorldAsm.asm](HelloWorldAsm.asm).
This file is written as a showcase for how to use some of the macros. If you are trying to read the macro, all definition of the used macro can be found at the top of the file. Most of the what do they mean can be found on this one page of NASM's documentation: [Chapter 4: The NASM Preprocessor](https://www.nasm.us/xdoc/2.16.03/html/nasmdoc4.html).
On the usage side, all macros that start with `begin_` will always need a corresponding `end_` macro.
For `counted_list`, it is expected that every entry will have a macro that increment the counter `%$i` by 1, thus keep a count of how many entries exist. In `constant`'s case, this count is also assigned to a label for each entry, so we can use name to refer to them later, here all of those labels begin with a upper-case `C`.
