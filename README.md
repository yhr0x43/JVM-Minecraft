# Minecraft Modding with JVM bytecode

[[Index](#index)]

## Introduction

This repo is a guide on how to write a Minecraft mod with a twist. The actual goal here isn't to produce something that can show up on the screen as soon as possible. Instead, I want to ask a simple question: "What if I understand what I am writing?" Hence this guide.

## Target Audience

Despite the premise of this guide, no previous knowledge of Java, JVM, or Minecraft Modding is expected. In fact, it is probably better without any previous knowledge, as you will get the most out of this guide.
Instead, I expect the reader to be familiar with computer terms. You **should** know what is a byte, file, byte-order, etc. But in the end, the only real requirement is to be enthusiastic and curious. You are the operator of your computer, have fun messing with it!

## Tools

I try to avoid depend on one certain tool, use whatever makes you happy. But here are some recommendations you probably want for this guide:

 - [OpenJDK JDK 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/) - version 21 as it is what the newest Minecraft version (1.21.1) requires. But as it turns out this actually doesn't matter, any version should be fine.
 - [NASM](https://nasm.us/) - using version 2.16.03 which is the newest version.
 - Any text editor, if you don't know where to start, if you can't make a choice `notepad.exe` or `gedit` will do just fine.
